Research to-do list:

1. Research molecular descriptors and QSARS and how to apply to our data
2. Research more about deep nueral nets/ convolutional networs especially in relation to 1).
3. Write motif finding algorithm to traverse through j48 tree to find most probably motifs 
4. Write algorithm to calculate peptide overlap percentage between toxicity groups in simulated data
5. Run MLP and SMO on No neutral data.
6. Find Machine learning based clustering software for proteins & run on our dataset
7. Make simulated data 7: have no neutral motifs, but instead just random
   just have random proteins (introduce more noise) & run on models to find
   if machines can still classify.
